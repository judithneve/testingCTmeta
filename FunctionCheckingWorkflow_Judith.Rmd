# Workflow

1. Extensively check function

2. Modify function as per checks

3. Read through function: is there anything (especially regarding errors/warnings) that should still be changed?

4. Discussion with Rebecca about unclear parts

5. Go through the function check process again

6. Modify documentation

# For each function:

## CTmeta

1. Extensively check function

Done.

2. Modify function as per checks

Done.

3. Read through function: is there anything (especially regarding errors/warnings) that should still be changed?

4. Discussion with Rebecca about unclear parts

5. Go through the function check process again

6. Modify documentation

### Don't forget:

1. Label

2. alpha: it doesn't seem to change anything as to how the function is running

3. Check_SigmaVAR.R: need to reformat the error messages

4. How to deal with both Gamma and SigmaVAR being specified - which one is more important? What if one of them is broken? What if they don't match?

Notes:

* it appears that neither can be broken - otherwise, we get errors.

* if both are specified, it seems Gamma takes precendence

### Smaller notes:

1. "The arguments SigmaVAR and Gamma are not found: Both SigmaVAR and Gamma are unknown; either one (or both) should be part of the input. In case of first matrix, specify 'SigmaVAR = SigmaVAR'."

What does this mean?

2. How do we deal with Phi that has too many columns?

Can't include an if statement for the case where it has more columns than q since q is defined from Phi.

3. Warning if vector for "Moderators":

Actually comes up with a bunch of warnings - it is clear what the problem is from them, but should this be reduced to just one?

4. Can moderators be factors?

This would explain the output of the non-numerical moderator input

5. Is a RE model with no BetweenLevel factor meant to work?

6. What do the entries in BetweenLevel mean?

i.e.: does it make a difference whether it's 0, 1, 2 or 1, 2, 3?

7. When PhiPlot = TRUE, the plot prints twice

8. When a model has moderators and PrintPlot = TRUE, the function breaks
