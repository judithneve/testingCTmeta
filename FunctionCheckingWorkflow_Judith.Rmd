# Workflow

1. Extensively check function

2. Modify function as per checks

3. Read through function: is there anything (especially regarding errors/warnings) that should still be changed?

4. Discussion with Rebecca about unclear parts

5. Go through the function check process again

6. Modify documentation


# For each function:

## CTmeta

### Workflow

1. Extensively check function

Done.

2. Modify function as per checks

Done.

3. Read through function: is there anything (especially regarding errors/warnings) that should still be changed?

Done.

4. Discussion with Rebecca about unclear parts

a. Some of the bigger essence changes are cutting out "currently, ... is of size ..." for matrices: giving a vector of dimensions does not provide clear enough information, and formatting it such that the dimensions are given is more hassle than necessary for an error message that clearly states the size it should be.

5. Go through the function check process again

6. Modify documentation

Done.

### Questions:

1. PrintPlot: error message when the plot can't be made

The question has been sent to Rebecca.

2. How do we deal with Phi that has too many columns?

Can't include an if statement for the case where it has more columns than q since q is defined from Phi.

3. Can moderators be factors?

This would explain the output of the non-numerical moderator input

4. What exactly should be in N?

5. "The arguments SigmaVAR and Gamma are not found: Both SigmaVAR and Gamma are unknown; either one (or both) should be part of the input. In case of first matrix, specify 'SigmaVAR = SigmaVAR'."

What does this mean?
