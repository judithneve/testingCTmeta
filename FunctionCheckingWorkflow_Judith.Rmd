# Workflow

1. Extensively check function

2. Modify function as per checks

3. Read through function: is there anything (especially regarding errors/warnings) that should still be changed?

4. Discussion with Rebecca about unclear parts

5. Go through the function check process again

6. Modify documentation


# For each function:

## CTmeta

### Questions:

1. How do we deal with Phi that has too many columns?

Can't include an if statement for the case where it has more columns than q since q is defined from Phi.
