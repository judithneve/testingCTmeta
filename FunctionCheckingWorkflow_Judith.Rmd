```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Extensively check function

2. Modify function as per checks

3. Read through function: is there anything (especially regarding errors/warnings) that should still be changed?

4. Discussion with Rebecca about unclear parts

5. Go through the function check process again

6. Modify documentation

# CTmeta

## Don't forget:

1. Label

2. alpha: it doesn't seem to change anything as to how the function is running

## Smaller notes:

1. "The arguments SigmaVAR and Gamma are not found: Both SigmaVAR and Gamma are unknown; either one (or both) should be part of the input. In case of first matrix, specify 'SigmaVAR = SigmaVAR'."

What does this mean?
